# Benchmarking Programming Languages

COMP30040 - 3rd Year Project - Benchmarking Programming Languages by Marios Yiannakou.

Supervisor: Bijan Parsia (bijan.parsia@manchester.ac.uk)

# Introduction
This project tackles/investigates the [*The Computer Language Benchmarks Game (Wikipedia)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game). An open-source software project, whose aim is to compare the implementations of a subset of simple algorithms in a plethora of programming languages, and determine (based on predetermined metrics) which is fastest in producing a result.

- ## Problem
The project does not tackle a *problem* per say. Based on your definition of what a problem is of course.

Here, the term *problem* will be used as an "obstacle in the way" of achieving the desired goal. An element introduced or discovered whilst researching the project, which has caused progress to come to a halt. The lack of active development on the source code can be considered a problem, but not the goal that needs to be achieved.

- ## Suggested resolution
A method of making progress towards the desired goal (e.g. resolving the "problem" described above), would be to expand upon existing algorithm test suites, improve the efficiency of existing algorithms to create a more fair comparison, or introduce new algorithms altogether.

Each of said resolutions can be done on a single or multiple programming languages. A good plan would be to focus on a single language to get a feel of how the process works, possibly open a pull-request and see how the general public reacts, before proceeding on multiple language implementations.

# Goals
- ## Personal
The main goal I wish to achieve out of this project, is discover programming languages which are considered unconventional (whether that be in a university or industrial setting), and would otherwise not have a chance to explore. As a consequence of writing the same problem in different languages, I believe this might cause an acceleration in the learning process, as I would need to only translate code from one language to the next. An excellent method, in my opinion, to quickly learn the syntax of many languages, as the result is clear. One needs to focus on 'the journey'.

Another goal is to cultivate my knowledge for efficient algorithm implementation, a basic necessity for someone with the title of "Computer Scientist". Being able to write different algorithms in different languages, might help with visualisation and memorisation of said algorithms. Though the actual goal would be to eventually get to an understanding of algorithms, such as to create my own. Whether that is an extension of an existing, or a new one from scratch designed for a specific problem.

- ## Original project
The original goal for this project, as quoted from:
- the project's [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game), "...comparing how a given subset of simple algorithms can be implemented in various popular programming languages."
- a ([page](https://wiki.c2.com/?GreatComputerLanguageShootout)) keeping updates regarding the project, "When I started this project, my goal was to compare all the major scripting languages..."

Any contribution to this goal is considered not only a success towards my degree project, but my personal growth and the community kept project as well.
